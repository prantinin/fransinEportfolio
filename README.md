## Things to improve on:
- list tiles of projects and experiences css/js can be combined into one external file.
- top nav bar can be an external file instead
- top nav bar buttons' fade out is not as smooth as fade in.
- experiences timeline layout has not been implemented.
- add video demos for project details and pictures for experiences.
- website's icon and global name should be consistent
- add animations.

- overall, website can be improved on into something more creative than a static website. (maybe i could add 3d elements)
